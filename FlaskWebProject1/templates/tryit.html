<p>Upload a picture of a vocab page from your textbook. We will find images and sentences to help you both learn the vocab and understand sentence structure and grammar of the language you are trying to learn! We'll also create a .csv file that you can download and copy-paste into Quizlet to help learn vocabulary terms.
